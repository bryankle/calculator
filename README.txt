This application was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum under the "Advanced Front End Development Projects" (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).

User stories:
	- I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
	- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
	- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell be the correct output.

Notes: This was the first advanced front end development project I completed in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum after completing all of the algorithm challenges. This challenge was definitely a good first project to take on after completing the algorithm portion of the curriculum, which I felt adequately prepared me for this project. At the time of building this, I was excited to begin the Javascript programming portion immediately, so I decided to get a jump start and piggy back off of the existing template with pre-existing HTML/CSS from the example on FreeCodeCamp's page, (credit goes to Justin Woodward as linked in FCC Codepen example). Creating this application was my first exposure to thorough documentation, which was neccessary to keep track of the bugs produced and fixed. I learned to keep my comments concise, detailing where I began and left off, what else needed to be done, comments regarding fixes. I quickly realized that documentation was important when my application ran into multiple issues which were neccessary to fix before moving foward since some features relied heavily on others (ie: chaining multiple operations including decimals). Documenting code was not as exciting as actually coding, which caused me to initially make short comments which made sense at the time, but later lost coherency when later revisited, which caused me to spend even more time down the line when debugging. The biggest takeaway I received from this was to make detailed and concise comments, I figure this will also be of utmost importance when I begin working in a team.
